                The cabinet is denominated since its foundation in the directory of particularization of the European union.
                
                Regardless of the complexity, SWB takes care to scrupulously dissect the deontological and ethical rules that are legislated there.
                
                The firm promotes innovative lobbying and governs, thanks to which the scheme of interests of legal persons grants genuine added value to the achievements of public initiative.</p>
