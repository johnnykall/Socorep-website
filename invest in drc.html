        <h2>Invest In The DR CONGO</h2>
        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo boasts some of the most abundant
             natural resources on the planet. With a strong economy, 
             rich farmland and bountiful mineral wealth, the DRC is progressively building 
             towards a brighter future. The DRC’s investment agency namely the National Agency 
             for Investment Promotion (ANAPI) provides investment facilitation services
              for initial investments over $200,000 and is mandated to simplify the investment 
              process, make procedures more transparent, assist foreign investors
               and improve the image of the DRC as an investment destination.</p>

            <h3>Invest In Energy</h3>
            <p>The DRC immense energy potential consists of non-renewable resources such as oil, natural gas and uranium, and renewable energy sources including hydroelectric, biomass, solar, wind, and geothermal power.  The government’s vision is to increase the level of service up to 32% in 2030.

                The Congo River, which is the second largest river in the world with its basin astride the Equator provides an energy potential estimated at 100,000 MW spread across 780 sites in 145 territories and 76 000 villages. This potential represents approximately 37% of the African overall potential and about 6% of the global potential.
                
                Of the total installed capacity in DRC estimated at 2,516 MW, Societe Nationale d’Electricite (SNEL) has a generation capacity of about 2,416 MW or 96% of Hydroelectric power which accounts of domestic power generation and is generated by the Inga I and Inga II dams that are located in Kongo Central province. Current production is only 6,000 to 7,000 Gwh.</p>

            <h3>Invest In Hydrocarbon</h3> 
            <p>Oil and gas discoveries in the east of the country give the DRC the second largest crude oil reserves in Central and Southern Africa.  These reserves are primarily located in the four major lakes bordering Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. The DRC has proven reserves of 180 million barrels, though estimates of total petroleum reserves exceed 5 billion barrels.  Currently, Congolese oil production is limited to the Coast Basin, yielding 25,000 barrels per day of offshore production, all of which are exported.

                Along with large recently identified oil fields, the DRC may hold as many as 30 billion cubic meters of methane and natural gas in the three major petroleum deposits.  Lake Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Burundi, has nearly 60 billion cubic meters of dissolved methane in its waters.  Beyond the estimated 60 billion cubic meters of methane in Lake Kivu, the lake generates as much as 250,000 cubic meters of methane annually.
                The DRC contains three sedimentary basins:
                
                The Coastal Basin located in Kongo Central and extends offshore to the Congo River estuary,
